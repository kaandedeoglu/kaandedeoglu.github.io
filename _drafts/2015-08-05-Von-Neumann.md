>There was a seminar for advanced students in Zürich that I was teaching and von Neumann was in the class. I came to a certain theorem, 
>and I said it is not proved and it may be difficult. Von Neumann didn't say anything but after five minutes he raised his hand. When I 
>called on him he went to the blackboard and proceeded to write down the proof. After that I was afraid of von Neumann. -- <cite>George Pólya, How to Solve it</cite>
