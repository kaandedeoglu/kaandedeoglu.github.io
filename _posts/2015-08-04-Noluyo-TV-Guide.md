Here's a video of the TV Guide I built for the last app I built, it's a Turkish Beamly/Viggle, a tv companion app about shows and movies. 

I really like how the whole view turned out. It uses a UITableView, UIView spring animations, and a lot of view shuffling and custom logic. Let me know if you're interested and I'll make a longer post explaining how it all works..
