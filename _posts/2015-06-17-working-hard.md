17k lines of Swift and counting...

I'm almost at the end of a big project. It's been a lot of fun.

Using Swift has worked out great, it allowed me to use abstractions that are nearly impossible to achieve in Objective-C. I've yet to have a crash from the test builds sent out to the team. Of course, there's a lot of refactoring to be done when we actually ship.

Swift 2.0 will make things much better, I'm already thinking of how much repeated code protocol extensions will save me. It was a good first serious project in a new language.
