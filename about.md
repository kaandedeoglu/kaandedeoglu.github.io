Hi! This is Kaan, iOS developer from Istanbul, Turkey.


I develop software in Objective-C and Swift, with some Scala on the side. I also tinker with Haskell, Clojure and Go in my spare time, I'm nowhere near using them for production code (yet!). My posts will mostly target the iOS people out there. You can reach me at <kaandedeoglu@me.com>
