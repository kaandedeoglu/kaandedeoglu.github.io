Hi! I'm Kaan, iOS developer from Istanbul, Turkey. 
I develop software in Objective-C and Swift, with some Scala on the side. I have also little experience (nowhere near professional proficiency) in Haskell, Clojure and Go. My posts will mostly target the iOS folks out there. You can reach me at <kaandedeoglu@me.com>
